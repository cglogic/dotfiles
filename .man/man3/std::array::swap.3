.SH NAME
std::array::swap \- std::array::swap

.SH Synopsis
   void swap( array& other );  \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Exchanges the contents of the container with those of other. Does not cause
   iterators and references to associate with the other container.

.SH Parameters

   other - container to exchange the contents with

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Exceptions

   noexcept specification:                                     \fI(until C++17)\fP
   noexcept(noexcept(std::swap(declval<T&>(), declval<T&>())))
   noexcept specification:                                     \fI(since C++17)\fP
   noexcept(std::is_nothrow_swappable<T>::value)

   For zero-sized arrays,
   noexcept specification:
   noexcept

.SH Complexity

   Linear in size of the container.
