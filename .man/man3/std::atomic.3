   Defined in header <atomic>
   template< class T >        \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   struct atomic;
   template<>                 \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   struct atomic<Integral>;
   template<>                 \fB(3)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP

   struct atomic<T*>;

   Each instantiation and full specialization of the std::atomic template defines an
   atomic type. If one thread writes to an atomic object while another thread reads
   from it, the behavior is well-defined (see memory model for details on data races)

   In addition, accesses to atomic objects may establish inter-thread synchronization
   and order non-atomic memory accesses as specified by std::memory_order.

   std::atomic may be instantiated with any TriviallyCopyable type T. std::atomic is
   neither copyable nor movable.

   The standard library provides specializations of the std::atomic template for the
   following types:

   1) One full specialization for the type bool and its typedef name is defined that is
   treated as a non-specialized std::atomic<T> except that it has standard layout,
   trivial default constructor, trivial destructors, and supports aggregate
   initialization syntax:

   Typedef name     Full specialization
   std::atomic_bool std::atomic<bool>

   2) Full specializations and typedefs for integral types, as follows:

   Typedef name               Full specialization
   std::atomic_char           std::atomic<char>
   std::atomic_schar          std::atomic<signed char>

   std::atomic_intmax_t       std::atomic<std::intmax_t>
   std::atomic_uintmax_t      std::atomic<std::uintmax_t>

   Note: std::atomic_intN_t, std::atomic_uintN_t, std::atomic_intptr_t, and
   atomic_uintptr_t are defined if and only if std::intN_t, std::uintN_t,
   std::intptr_t, and std::uintptr_t are defined, respectively.

   These specializations have standard layout, trivial default constructors, and
   trivial destructors. They support aggregate initialization syntax. Besides the
   operations provided for all atomic types, these specializations have additional
   atomic operations appropriate to integer types such as fetch_add, fetch_sub,
   fetch_and, fetch_or, fetch_xor.

   3) Partial specializations std::atomic<T*> for all pointer types. These
   specializations have standard layout, trivial default constructors, and trivial
   destructors. They support aggregate initialization syntax. Besides the operations
   provided for all atomic types, these specializations additionally support atomic
   arithmetic operations appropriate to pointer types, such as fetch_add, fetch_sub.

.SH Notes

   There are non-member function template equivalents for all member functions of
   std::atomic. Those non-member functions may be additionally overloaded for types
   that are not specializations of std::atomic, but are able to guarantee atomicity.
   The only such type in the standard library is std::shared_ptr<T>.
