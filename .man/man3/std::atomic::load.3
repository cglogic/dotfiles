.SH NAME
std::atomic::load \- std::atomic::load

.SH Synopsis
   T load( std::memory_order order = std::memory_order_seq_cst ) const;
   T load( std::memory_order order = std::memory_order_seq_cst ) const   \fI(since C++11)\fP
   volatile;

   Atomically loads and returns the current value of the atomic variable. Memory is
   affected according to the value of order.

   order must be one of std::memory_order_relaxed, std::memory_order_consume,
   std::memory_order_acquire or std::memory_order_seq_cst. Otherwise the behavior is
   undefined.

.SH Parameters

   order - memory order constraints to enforce

.SH Return value

   The current value of the atomic variable.

.SH Exceptions

   noexcept specification:
