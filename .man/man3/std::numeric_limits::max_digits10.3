.SH NAME
std::numeric_limits::max_digits10 \- std::numeric_limits::max_digits10

.SH Synopsis
   static constexpr int max_digits10  \fI(since C++11)\fP

   The value of std::numeric_limits<T>::max_digits10 is the number of base-10 digits
   that are necessary to uniquely represent all distinct values of the type T, such as
   necessary for serialization/deserialization to text. This constant is meaningful for
   all floating-point types.

.SH Notes

   Unlike most mathematical operations, the conversion of a floating-point value to
   text and back is exact as long as at least max_digits10 were used (9 for float, 17
   for double): it is guaranteed to produce the same floating-point value, even though
   the intermediate text representation is not exact. It may take over a hundred
   decimal digits to represent the precise value of a float in decimal notation.
