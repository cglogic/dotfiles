.SH NAME
std::vector::clear \- std::vector::clear

.SH Synopsis
   void clear();

   Removes all elements from the container.

   Invalidates any references, pointers, or iterators referring to contained elements.
   Any past-the-end iterators are also invalidated.

   Leaves the capacity() of the vector unchanged (note: the standard's restriction on
   the changes to capacity is in the specification of vector::reserve, see [1])
