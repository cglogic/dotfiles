.TH std::vector<bool>::reference 3 "2018.03.28" "http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH NAME
std::vector<bool>::reference \- std::vector<bool>::reference

.SH Synopsis
   class reference;

   The std::vector<bool> specialization defines std::vector<bool>::reference as a
   publicly-accessible nested class. std::vector<bool>::reference proxies the behavior
   of references to a single bit in std::vector<bool>.

   The primary use of std::vector<bool>::reference is to provide an l-value that can be
   returned from operator[].

   Any reads or writes to a vector that happen via a std::vector<bool>::reference
   potentially read or write to the entire underlying vector.

.SH Member functions

   constructor   constructs the reference. Accessible only to std::vector<bool> itself
                 \fI(public member function)\fP
   destructor    destroys the reference
                 \fI(public member function)\fP
   operator=     assigns a bool to the referenced bit
                 \fI(public member function)\fP
   operator bool returns the referenced bit
                 \fI(public member function)\fP
   flip          flips the referenced bit
                 \fI(public member function)\fP

std::vector<bool>::~reference

   ~reference()

   Destroys the reference.

std::vector<bool>::reference::operator=

   reference& operator=( bool x );
   reference& operator=( const reference& x );

   Assigns a value to the referenced bit.
