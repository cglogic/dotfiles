.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <memory>
   template< class T > class weak_ptr;  \fI(since C++11)\fP

   std::weak_ptr is a smart pointer that holds a non-owning ("weak") reference to an
   object that is managed by std::shared_ptr. It must be converted to std::shared_ptr
   in order to access the referenced object.

   std::weak_ptr models temporary ownership: when an object needs to be accessed only
   if it exists, and it may be deleted at any time by someone else, std::weak_ptr is
   used to track the object, and it is converted to std::shared_ptr to assume temporary
   ownership. If the original std::shared_ptr is destroyed at this time, the object's
   lifetime is extended until the temporary std::shared_ptr is destroyed as well.

   In addition, std::weak_ptr is used to break circular references of std::shared_ptr.

.SH Member types

   Member type  Definition
   element_type T                       \fI(until C++17)\fP
                std::remove_extent_t<T> \fI(since C++17)\fP

.SH Member functions

   constructor   creates a new weak_ptr
                 \fI(public member function)\fP
   destructor    destroys a weak_ptr
                 \fI(public member function)\fP
   operator=     assigns the weak_ptr
                 \fI(public member function)\fP
.SH Modifiers
   reset         releases the ownership of the managed object
                 \fI(public member function)\fP
   swap          swaps the managed objects
                 \fI(public member function)\fP
.SH Observers
   use_count     returns the number of shared_ptr objects that manage the object
                 \fI(public member function)\fP
   expired       checks whether the referenced object was already deleted
                 \fI(public member function)\fP
   lock          creates a shared_ptr that manages the referenced object
                 \fI(public member function)\fP
   owner_before  provides owner-based ordering of weak pointers
                 \fI(public member function)\fP

.SH Non-member functions

   std::swap(std::weak_ptr) specializes the std::swap algorithm
   \fI(C++11)\fP                  \fI(function template)\fP

.SH Example

   Demonstrates how lock is used to ensure validity of the pointer.

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <memory>

 std::weak_ptr<int> gw;

 void f()
 {
     std::cout << "use_count == " << gw.use_count() << ": ";
     if (auto spt = gw.lock()) { // Has to be copied into a shared_ptr before usage
         std::cout << *spt << "\\n";
     }
     else {
         std::cout << "gw is expired\\n";
     }
 }

 int main()
 {
     {
         auto sp = std::make_shared<int>(42);
         gw = sp;

         f();
     }

     f();
 }

.SH Output:

 use_count == 1: 42
 use_count == 0: gw is expired
